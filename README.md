# Disclaimer

This is a rework of the project s0md3v/roop that I am working on for entertainment and educational purposes. It does not aim to be better or more popular; it is just a fork made the way I want it to be.

The tasks that I'm aiming to accomplish here are:
1) rewriting the code using OOP
2) providing code coverage with tests
3) adding strict typing and static analysis on top of it
4) using cv2 to provide in-memory video manipulation
5) do better swapping on rotated faces
6) do face selection

And yes, I named this project like 💩, because why not? 

# Original readme (for now): 

Take a video and replace the face in it with a face of your choice. You only need one image of the desired face. No dataset, no training.

That's it, that's the software. You can watch some demos [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KHv8n_rd3Lcr2v7jBq1yPSTWM554Gq8e?usp=sharing).

## Disclaimer

Better deepfake software than this already exist, this is just a hobby project I created to learn about AI. Users must get consent from the concerned people before using their face and must not hide the fact that it is a
deepfake when posting content online. I am not responsible for malicious behaviour of end-users.

To prevent misuse, it has a built-in check which prevents the program from working on inappropriate media.

## How do I install it?

**Issues according installation will be closed without ceremony from now on, we cannot handle the amount of requests.**

There are two types of installations: basic and gpu-powered.

- **Basic:** It is more likely to work on your computer but it will also be very slow. You can follow instructions for the basic install [here](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop/wiki/1.-Installation).

- **GPU:** If you have a good GPU and are ready for solving any software issues you may face, you can enable GPU which is wayyy faster. To do this, first follow the basic install instructions given above and then follow
  GPU-specific instructions [here](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop/wiki/2.-GPU-Acceleration).

## How do I use it?

> Note: When you run this program for the first time, it will download some models ~300MB in size.

Executing `python run.py` command will launch this window:
![gui-demo](gui-demo.png)

Choose a face (image with desired face) and the target image/video (image/video in which you want to replace the face) and click on `Start`. Open file explorer and navigate to the directory you select your output to be
in. You will find a directory named `<video_title>` where you can see the frames being swapped in realtime. Once the processing is done, it will create the output file. That's it.

Don't touch the FPS checkbox unless you know what you are doing.

Additional command line arguments are given below:

```
options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s SOURCE_PATH, --source SOURCE_PATH
                        select an source image
  -t TARGET_PATH, --target TARGET_PATH
                        select an target image or video
  -o OUTPUT_PATH, --output OUTPUT_PATH
                        select output file or directory
  --frame-processor {face_swapper,face_enhancer} [{face_swapper,face_enhancer} ...]
                        pipeline of frame processors
  --keep-fps            keep original fps
  --keep-audio          keep original audio
  --keep-frames         keep temporary frames
  --many-faces          process every face
  --video-encoder {libx264,libx265,libvpx-vp9}
                        adjust output video encoder
  --video-quality VIDEO_QUALITY
                        adjust output video quality
  --max-memory MAX_MEMORY
                        maximum amount of RAM in GB
  --execution-provider {cpu,...} [{cpu,...} ...]
                        execution provider
  --execution-threads EXECUTION_THREADS
                        number of execution threads
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
```

Looking for a CLI mode? Using the -s/--source argument will make the program in cli mode.

## Future plans

- [ ] Improve the quality of faces in results
- [ ] Replace a selective face throughout the video
- [ ] Support for replacing multiple faces
